## Emotion Detection System using Deep Learning

---

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based emotion detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to facial images. The system performs:
- Image preprocessing
- CNN model training
- Hyperparameter tuning (grid search, random search)
- Model evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Model interpretability with SHAP visualizations

This work was developed as part of the course Introduction √† l‚ÄôIntelligence Artificielle (2024-2025), under Prof. Faouzi Marzouki, Ecole Sup√©rieure de la Technologie, T√©touan.

## Objectives
- Learn to design and train CNN models for image classification.
- Apply computer vision techniques for emotion recognition.
- Analyze and interpret model performance.
- Connect AI systems with the physical environment through vision sensors.

## Files
- emotionDetection.py : Builds, trains, evaluates, and saves the CNN emotion detection model.
- predict_external_images.py : Tests the model on both FER-2013 dataset images and external images.
- FER-2013.csv : Dataset containing grayscale images of faces and their emotion labels.
- best_fer2013_emotion_model.h5 : Saved best-performing model after hyperparameter tuning.
- fer2013_emotion_model.h5 : Initial trained model before tuning.

## Installation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone this repository or download the code.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:
- pip install tensorflow scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib opencv-python shap (bash)
3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure you have the FER-2013.csv dataset in the working directory.

---

## How to Run
python emotionDetection.py (on bash)
This will:
- Load and preprocess data (normalization, one-hot encoding)
- Build a CNN model
- Train and save the model
- Perform hyperparameter tuning and save the best model

---

## Predict emotions on external images
python predict_external_images.py (on bash)
You can modify this script to specify external image paths for prediction.
